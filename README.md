This repository contains code to calculate closest mass Covid-19 vaccination sites for each city and town in Massachusetts for an analysis posted at [http://apps.machlis.com/shiny/ma_corona_virus/vaccine_distance.html](http://apps.machlis.com/shiny/ma_corona_virus/vaccine_distance.html).

The R Markdown document generating the HTML page with narrative and conclusions is at [https://github.com/smach/vaccineSites/blob/master/vaccine_distance.Rmd](https://github.com/smach/vaccineSites/blob/master/vaccine_distance.Rmd). The R script generating some of the data analysis for the R Markdown doc is at [https://github.com/smach/vaccineSites/blob/master/distance.R](https://github.com/smach/vaccineSites/blob/master/distance.R).
